Purpose of the fork is to try out improving performance and adapt the api to something I easier to use. 

This will come with a lot of loss of functionality as what is kept is a reflection of what I want.

Also abandons backwards compability for py <3.10

# Overview

pyNastran is an interface library to the various Nastran file formats (BDF, OP2, OP4).
Using the BDF interface, you can read/edit/write Nastran geometry without worrying about
field formatting.  Many checks are also performed to verify that your model is correct.
Using the OP2 interface, you can read large result files quickly and efficiently.
Additionally, you can also extract a subset of the result data and write OP2/F06 result
files.  For a more detailed list of features, see:

# News

<!---

I yet again went down a bit of rabbit hole to improve the speed of the BDF, 
but this time I'm much happier with the results.  Still, getting back to parity
takes a lot of time and it's not quite there.  It does simplify MSC HDF5 
integration, so once I've added methods for updating more complicated objects
(e.g., PBARL, PCOMP, RBE3), HDF5 will be next. If you want to test it out, 
it's not included with the official release, but is found in 
``pyNastran.dev.bdf_vectorized3``, so not my first attempt :)

This should be hidden...
